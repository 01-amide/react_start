      Web App Manifest
      
      The manifest.json file provides metadata used when your web app is installed on a
      user's mobile device or desktop. This enables Progressive Web App (PWA) features
      such as:
      - App installation prompts
      - Offline functionality
      - App-like experience
      
      See: https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/web-app-manifest/

      PUBLIC_URL Environment Variable
      
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      This is a special environment variable that gets replaced with the URL of the `public` 
      folder during the build process.
      
      Benefits of using %PUBLIC_URL%:
      - Works correctly with client-side routing
      - Supports non-root public URLs (e.g., when deployed to a subdirectory)
      - Ensures assets are loaded from the correct path
      
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.
      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      This div serves as the mounting point for the React application.
      The React app will render all its content inside this element.

      Build Process Information
      
      This HTML file is a template that gets processed during the build step.
      If you open it directly in the browser, you will see an empty page because:
      - React components haven't been rendered yet
      - JavaScript bundles haven't been loaded
      - The build process hasn't processed the template
      
      What happens during build:
      1. React components are compiled and bundled
      2. JavaScript bundles are generated
      3. The build step places the bundled scripts into the <body> tag
      4. %PUBLIC_URL% placeholders are replaced with actual URLs
      
      Development vs Production:
      - Development: Run `npm start` or `yarn start` to start the dev server
      - Production: Use `npm run build` or `yarn build` to create a production bundle
      
      You can add additional elements to this file such as:
      - Web fonts
      - Meta tags for SEO
      - Analytics scripts
      - Custom CSS
      - Third-party integrations
