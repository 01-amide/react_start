## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd rct_start
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm start
   # or
   yarn start
   ```

4. **Open your browser**
   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the application

### Available Scripts

- **`npm start`**: Starts the development server with hot reloading
- **`npm build`**: Creates a production build in the `build` folder
- **`npm test`**: Runs the test suite in watch mode
- **`npm run eject`**: Ejects from Create React App (⚠️ irreversible)

## 🏗️ Application Architecture

### Component Structure

The application follows a simple, single-page architecture:

```
App Component
├── Navigation Bar (React Bootstrap Navbar)
├── Header Section (Personal Introduction)
└── Card Gallery (Nature Images with Descriptions)
```

### Key Components

#### 1. App.js
- **Purpose**: Main application component
- **Features**: 
  - Responsive navigation bar
  - Personal introduction header
  - Image gallery with Bootstrap cards
- **Styling**: Combination of Bootstrap classes and inline styles

#### 2. Navigation Bar
- **Component**: React Bootstrap Navbar
- **Features**:
  - Responsive design (collapses on mobile)
  - Brand logo/text
  - Navigation links
  - Dropdown menu
- **Accessibility**: ARIA controls and proper semantic markup

#### 3. Card Gallery
- **Layout**: Flexbox-based grid system
- **Features**:
  - Three nature-themed cards
  - Consistent image sizing (160px height)
  - Action buttons for each card
- **Images**: High-quality nature photography from external sources

### Styling Approach

- **Bootstrap Integration**: Core styling and responsive behavior
- **Inline Styles**: Component-specific styling for layout control
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with Bootstrap breakpoints

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is built with mobile-first responsive design principles:

- **Breakpoints**: Bootstrap's responsive grid system
- **Navigation**: Collapsible navbar for mobile devices
- **Layout**: Flexible card grid that adapts to screen size
- **Typography**: Scalable text that remains readable on all devices

## 🔧 Performance Features

### Web Vitals Monitoring

The application includes comprehensive performance monitoring through the `reportWebVitals` function:

- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: Measures visual stability
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: Measures interactivity
- **FCP (First Contentful Paint)**: Measures loading performance
- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: Measures loading performance
- **TTFB (Time to First Byte)**: Measures server response time

### Performance Optimization

- **Dynamic Imports**: Web Vitals library loaded only when needed
- **React 19 Features**: Concurrent rendering and improved performance
- **Bootstrap Optimization**: Efficient CSS framework with minimal overhead

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes a testing setup with Jest and React Testing Library:

```bash
# Run tests in watch mode
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm test -- --coverage
```

### Testing Libraries
- **Jest**: Test runner and assertion library
- **React Testing Library**: Component testing utilities
- **DOM Testing Library**: DOM testing helpers
- **User Event**: User interaction simulation

## 🚀 Deployment

### Production Build

1. **Create production build**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `build` folder**
   - Upload to web server
   - Deploy to cloud platforms (Netlify, Vercel, AWS, etc.)
   - Use static site hosting services

### Environment Variables

The application supports environment variables for configuration:

- **`PUBLIC_URL`**: Base URL for public assets
- **`REACT_APP_*`**: Custom environment variables

## 🔍 Code Quality
